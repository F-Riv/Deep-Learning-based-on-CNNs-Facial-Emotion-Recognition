# Structure 
- Facial_em_recognition.ipynb is a jupiter notebook displaying step-by-step different experiments on the CNN structure used for the facial emotion recognition task. The dataset used is the FER2013 from https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview
- Plots.py contains the code for the plots. 
- Create_models.py contains the code of the structure of the best performing models that are used for testing.

  Results are then compared with the ones obtained by fine-tuned EfficientNet B0 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)
